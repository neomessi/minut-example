A minimum utility Node framework for modern web applications that sets up in a minute.

Currently supports only React and MongoDB.


# Prerequisites

- Recent version of Node
- MongoDB account (https://www.mongodb.com/try)


# Setup

- Easiest to just clone the example repo: https://github.com/neomessi/minut-example
  (then you can delete the .git folder and reinit if you want)

- create an .env file:
    COOKIE_SIGNATURE_PHRASE=makeup something here using multiple words
    DB_CON_STR=mongodb+srv://web:rest of your string
    DB_NAME=your collection name

- create local certs
    something like:
    openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout localserver.key -out localserver.cert

- run:
    npm run dev

- Go to (it only runs https):
    https://localhost:9876/


# Framework explained: Backend

The main concept is that in your application you define:
- your routes in routes.js
- any guards that a route has in guards.js (these restrict access to a route)
- any handlers that a route has in handlers.js/apiHandlers.js

All your handler and guard functions are passed a "Consumer" object as well as the global MongoDB that you can optionally use.
This is how you interface with the framework (you're a consumer of the framework).
All consumer methods are defined in a section below.

Session state is handled for you! There are built-in security functions in the Consumer to handle login/logout etc.

The consumer object provides access to the current user via: consumer.currentUserInfo


# Framework explained: Frontend

The framework relies on folder conventions to find your html/css/js.

js bundles are handled for you (via Webpack) - just drop your components in:
    yourapp\gui\web\src\script\components\autoImported

and in your html:
    <div data-component="YourComponent"></div>

And that's it! But that's just the default - you can also customize your js bundles easily.

But you can also pass parameters into your component via data-props attribute.

You can also split your js bundles in subdirectories to reduce the size of the file.


-- passing data from backned to frontend --

This is done via the Consumer swapData method.

In your handler:
    consumer.swapData("message", "Hi there!");

In your html it will output the swapped message:
    <div>~`data:message`~</div>

This is also one way you can pass data into your components:
    <div data-component="YourComponent" data-props='{ "userName": "~`data:userName`~" }'></div>

That's it. Note these things were _omitted_ because it is the author's opinion they are better handled with components:
- conditional display logic
- server side includes


# Consumer object API

currentUser: {
    currentUserName,  // note: password purposely not exposed (handled by framework)
    currentUserInfo: { /* your info here */ },
}

request: {
    method,
    params: {
        url: {},
        form: {}
    };
}

response: {
    body
    swapData(key, val)
}

security: {
    // all these functions return promises:
    login(un, pw)
    logout()
    register(un, pw)
    setCurrentUserInfo({})
    saveCurrentUserInfo(consumer)
    saveFormFieldsToCurrentUserInfo(cnsmr, fillable) // see below utils.fillObject
}

utils: {
    fillObject(obj, fields, fillable)
    /**
     * 
     * @param {object} obj represents Mongo document
     * @param {object} fields form fields (key/value pairs)
     * @param {array} fillable indicates which form fields (keys) to populate in object (simliar to Laravel)
     * @param {boolean} convertFields if true, will change form field names first_name or FirstName to firstName

# Implementation notes

Expects the following to be defined in process.env:
    You can use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
    And to run: $ NODE_ENV=development node index.js

COOKIE_SIGNATURE_PHRASE #used for signing httpOnly cookies - if change this all cookies will be invalidated
DB_CON_STR #mongo only supported

Configuration options can be found in config.json*

*This is a WIP and config options may/may not be honored and defaults may be used.


# Internal notes/to do list

-share validation client/server?
    minut.data.json # (actually lowdb) this has bundles (js: []/css: []), validations (regex - this can be used by client/server)

-api routes:
    +GET
    +POST
    (PUT/PATCH)

-finish security
    -old adminauth idea (impersonation)? apikey in .env, password that changes every time - success or failure
    (-account recovery phrase (md5)? gen w/npm words

-tests for consumer functions
-config.json as arg to run - have key for dev/prod overwrite defaults
-force https
(csrf regular POST (maybe let consumer handle this)
(regex guards
(Wrap promise around mysql db calls (for rdbms use laravel?)

-vue, MySql support

SEPARATE PROJECTS?:
-tommy-tools/dwimform (local_modules) w/redux "a provider you register reducers with"
-paging {$qlimit}/{$qoffset}
