/**
 * This is for user of framework
 * methods on these objects will be passed to route handlers:
 *  handler( request, response, currentUserInfo )
 * 
 * currentUserInfo has all the fields in the collection users.info.
 * Note: the users _id field is purposely omitted - that is never exposed (or even used by app),
 * instead a tempory "permit id" is used to get user data (which is temporary) -
 * but all of that is handled for you by framework (the permit id is stored in an encrypted cookie)
 *
 * ~*~ should this be outside of lib?
